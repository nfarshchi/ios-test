# ios-test
Welcome to Luxury Escapes iOS test project. Here is a simple app that we need you to fork and and after finishing the task submit the pull request.

## What is the task
Showing data!! Yeah. There are 3 json file under Data folder, consider them as response of API calls. 
We want you to read those data and populate a tableView with them. Consider each file represent a category.

** As you can see in one files, there is no response from server and 404! in this case we need to show an error message to user.

## Design
Should be very simple, like above image. we prefer using swift-UI but it is candidate choice.

## Coding
For this task, please follow MVVM design pattern. If you need to add/use third party libraries, use Cocoapods.

Best of luck.
